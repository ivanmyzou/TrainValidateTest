## 1. Overview

Modelling under data-driven machine learning describes the process of building models based on collected data usually of a large volume. The eventual goal is to come up with a model with decent performance. Limiting the scope to supervised learning, we would like the model to make predictions by feeding it with inputs and such predictions must resemble actual experience reasonably well (example 1). Though under the context of unsupervised learning, there are no specific predictions task, model performance can be quantified through other means (example 2).

*Example 1:* 
One has collected one-dimensional features *x* and one-dimensional responses *y* (as plotted below) from a sample and the goal is to predict *y* from *x*.

The model in the left represented by the red line will be a very poor model as on average its predicted values are far away from the actual observations. On the contrary, the model in the right would be a much better model as it closely resembles actual observations.

*Example 2:*

The model building process consists of two main components:
* **model selection**: This component sees the optimal model or model type to be picked out of a pool of candidates, whether picking the best type of model to be trained or selecting the best model from within a type. This former can be data-driven and can be as simple as appointing the type of the model based of prior knowledge. The latter oftern integrates into the process of training and validating.
* **model training**: With a selected type of model, this component adjust the configurations of the model by tuning its parameters so that its performance over the data at hand is reasonbaly optimised.
As mentioned already, the two steps do not necessarily come in chronological order as there are often some back-and-forths while training and validating the model.

All models contains hyperparameters and parameters.
