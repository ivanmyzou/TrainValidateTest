# An Illustrative Guide to Training, Validating and Testing in Modelling.

A large part of data-driven machine learning is to do with modelling training where the model parameters are progressively updated with optimisation algorithms so that the model progressively improves as reflected through some performance criteria. Closely related to model training, validating and testing also play a huge role in ensuring the model may generalise its performance to relevant scenarios outside of training. Failing to understand those concepts pose substantial risks in judging how well the models perform. This then leads to diminished benefit from applying models.

As an analogy, a modeller training a model is similar to a student studying for exams. The goal of training a model is to apply it in making a prediction or in a more general sense producing some insights regarding the matter at hand. Similarly, a student studies in aim of performing well in exams and perhaps becoming capable of applying the contents learned in real life. Like model training, a student learn contents by correcting mistakes and updating his or her interpretations. Model validation on the other hand is comparable to the student taking mock exams to validate how well the contents have been learned. Model testing at the end is like a final exam at the end where completely unseen questions are used to assessed how well the student is performing.
